- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @reponly
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Nature, Mountain Bike, Roadbike, Camping, Hiking, and Software Development, of course!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various things like Python, PHP, CSS...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a retired project manager... so there's nothing that I must, there are only things that I want to do.
